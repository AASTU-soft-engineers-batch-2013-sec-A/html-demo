    HEALTH IT NEWS : FEDSCOOP
    HHS, health information networks expect rollout of trusted data exchange 
    next year: Micky Tripathi Multiple applicants expect to have fully 
    operational health information networks for securely sharing clinical 
    data within a year of receiving approval, according to National Coordinator 
    for Health IT Micky Tripathi. A couple networks are live, and the Office of
    the National Coordinator for Health IT hopes the first group — among 12 entities
    that submitted letters of intent — will be officially designated qualified health 
    information networks (QHINs) in early 2023. Part of the Department of Health and Human
    Services, ONC published a framework in January for exchanging health information nationwide: 
    the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).

    HEALTH IT NEWS : THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS
    Medicare Pushes Medical Providers to Share Public Health Data Electronically
    In addition, CMS should address health equity by encouraging providers to submit
    complete data—including patient demographics—to public health agencies so officials 
    can understand how health threats are affecting different communities. CMS, the Centers 
    for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health 
    Information Technology—the federal agency that oversees health IT—should continue collaborating 
    to identify standards for electronically collecting and sharing more granular data. 
    For example, that could include an individual’s race, ethnicity, and contact information,
    all of which can make it easier to track and respond to disease outbreaks among diverse communities.

    Not-So-Hidden Gems in the 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule: Get to Know the Conditions of Certification
    Do not get me wrong, the information blocking regulations are important, but let’s not
    forget that the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) and our implementing regulations 
    (Cures Act Final Rule) had a few other impactful provisions. In particular, certain changes
    to the ONC Health IT Certification Program may seem like “more of the same” 
    for health IT developers, but in reality they are really important and beneficial to clinicians, 
    researchers, and the public alike.

    the HL7 FHIR community to identify scalability gaps and support the development of necessary 
    infrastructure for actionable solutions. Its members include technology companies, health systems,
    payers, and government agencies.
